# Market Trend Analysis & Stock Prediction

This repository provides tools for stock price trend analysis and prediction using machine learning models, trained on Nifty 100 stocks. It includes a Jupyter Notebook for data processing/modeling and a Streamlit app for interactive predictions.

## Getting Started

### 1. Create a Python Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Run the Notebook (Installs All Dependencies)

Open Jupyter and run the main notebook step by step:

```bash
jupyter notebook
# Open notebooks/StockPrediction_LSTM_v3.ipynb and run all cells sequentially
```

> **Note:** The first cell in the notebook will automatically install all required libraries (including TensorFlow, Keras, yfinance, etc.) based on your OS.

### 3. Run the Streamlit App

After running the notebook and generating the required data/model files, launch the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open an interactive web app for stock prediction in your browser.

## Example Output

- Model performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R²)
- Predicted value for any given stock from the Nifty 100 symbols

## Notes

- All data is stored in the `data/` and `json_files/` folders.
- Models are saved in the `models/` directory.
- The Streamlit app uses the trained model and data generated by the notebook.
