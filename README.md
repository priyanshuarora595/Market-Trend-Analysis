# Stock Prediction Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for stock price trend analysis and prediction using Python. The notebook demonstrates data collection, preprocessing, visualization, and the application of machine learning models to predict stock prices.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering
- Implementation of machine learning models for stock price prediction
- Model evaluation and visualization of results

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages (see below)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd trend_analysis
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or install the main dependencies manually:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn plotly yfinance textblob requests datasets transformers
   ```

### Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `stock_prediction_model.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.

## File Structure
- `stock_prediction_model.ipynb`: Main notebook for stock trend analysis and prediction.

## Example Output
The notebook provides:
- Data visualizations (price trends, moving averages, etc.)
- Model performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE)
- Predicted vs. actual stock price plots
